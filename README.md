"Okay, think about it. You're on Zoom or Teams. 
Then, someone decides to share their screen so you can see something on the internet:
A Google Slides, a Youtube video... Anything in their browser.
So the question is: do you take a sly peek at their tabs?

Rethorical question.
Of course you do. We all do.

It's called curiosity, or just being nosy.
Now, imagine turning those tabs that everyone looks at into something more useful."
