            Okay, think about it. You're on Zoom or Teams. <br>
            Then, someone decides to share their screen so you can see something on the internet: <br>
            A Google Slides, a Youtube video... Anything in their browser. <br>
            So the question is: do you take a sly peek at their tabs? <br><br>
            <b>Rethorical question.</b><br> 
            Of course you do. We all do. <br><br>
